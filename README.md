## WTF
This is: 
A list of synth sounds, commonly used in EDM. Example: hoover, supersaw, perfect 5th bass, etc.

## HTF
### How this works:
In the forum of EDMP under the Awesome List of Presets channel you can discuss anything regarding the List, freely.
$new <Synth Sound  - Name Comonly Known As > 

First call the function $new , add the Synth name using Capital Letters, e.g. Hoover, leave no spaces‚Ä¶ So if it is more use an underscore - Square_Hoover; define the characteristics of the sound after that. Keep it simple, understandable, not too complicated and professional. So that a beginner can understand it. 

Save explaining how it is made for the actual preset folder (more on that later). 

Second, you get a unique number,  add that unique number to the preset and the wav. 
Post your preset and your wav. 
One of the mods will upload it if your sound is accepted. 
Standards and file naming conventions needs to be upheld for the benefit of all of us.
Please be willing to cooperate if we believe your valued contribution still needs changes.

# Issues With Presets
Use the "Issues" section of the Github repository, if you have an issue with a preset.
An issue may be anything from: it just not working, to the preset not being a commonly accurate representation of the sound you are trying to achieve. 

Most presets will go through community discussion and a feedback and editing process, before being included the repository. 

Use the preset name as the subject of the issue - to avoid duplicates. 
Back your issue up with facts.
Not just : "no bro, thats not a highpassed, supersaw hoover‚Äù
Explain why and back it up with facts.
Preferably have the synth of the preset.
So that you are able to precisely prove your point. 
Give feedback on the preset constructively.
‚Äúa futurbass supersaw has the settings‚Ä¶ a, b and c.. as seen in : <link>, <link>, <link>

# Forking Presets
You can for presets, just try go from certain starting points/
Fork the standard square wave preset of your synth, for example, so that we are all on the same page.
Or if yiou want to make the standard hoover more complex, fork the standard hoover preset. 

# Policy for Submitted Format
For simple waveforms:
Make a 2 bar .wav
Using the notes C6-C5-C4-C3.
Each note lasting half a bar.
bounce it out in .wav
Create a folder wherever on your HD.  
Include the project file, preset, and the wav. 
Same name for all the files, including the folder. 
The only difference should be the file name extension. 
Zip that folder and upload it. Post the link on the EDMP Discord, Awesome.

As waveforms that we need, get more complex , example long, evolving pads - >
